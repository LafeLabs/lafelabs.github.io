# Electromagneticks

Divide the book up by system/machine, each of which is physically integrated with the "document"

0. build the tools 
1. the smart phone, use for field measurement 
2. basic electrics: USB, AC, DC, batteries
3. transformers, investigate with smart phone
4. go get all the trash: 


motors
scanning imaging
mu probe

practical electrochemistry

tubes and pumps

quantum tunneling in aluminum

fluidics/electrics combined

electrostatic generators and motors at high voltage

all the trash

philosophy

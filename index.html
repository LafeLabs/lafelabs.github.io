<h3>About</h3>

My name is Lafe.  I studied math, physics, and technology for 20 years(Berkeley BA, 1998 math and physics,
 Yale applied physics PhD 2006), then started two companies, and after a few years
 concluded that capitalism is in contradiction with my goals for science and technology 
 and now I build free things, where I try to use as strict a definition of "free" as 
 possible.  
 
 <p>
 
 I don't sell stuff, and I try not work for a wage(although I do now to survive).  
 I build things and give them away. If people want to <a href  = "https://www.patreon.com/Lafelabs">patronize</a> my work, I can spend more time on it and have resources to recruit others 
 to the cause. If no one donates, I'll get by and do the work regardless because I can't help it, though.
<p>

My definition of "free" is defined at extreme length in the free political manifesto below, 
but the short version is for a thing to be free you need to not just pay no money, you
need to be able to duplicate the whole thing yourself and teach others to duplicate, all 
without money or mining.  "Open source" is almost completely meaningless for physical artifacts;
it's not free unless it's free to copy and also the copy is free to copy etc. ad infinitum.  
It must also be free to modify, and it must be free to keep getting parts to build more, 
since all feedstock materials are based on streams of things, not just static reservoirs of things.
<p>
Thus I begin with paper and cardboard, since they are some of the most ubiquitous "waste" streams of
our current industrial system, and it's easy to make things that both look cool and are functional using these
tools.  Follow whatever social media you like the most from the list below to get updates on 
actual built artifacts as well as instructions to build your own as this project progresses.
<p>
Also social media will tell you how to find me in the physical world again in the future so that you can
get more free stuff made from trash!  The web side of this project connects the dots, but 
this is a physical project that happens in the physical world.  Without the cardboard, rocks,
wood, busted radios and old rotting shoes this is nothing, so come on down and make some magic from the
trash.

<h3>About</h3>

I studied math, physics and technology for 20 years(Berkeley BA, 1998 math and physics,
 Yale applied physics PhD 2006), then started two companies, and after a few years
 concluded that capitalism is in contradiction with my goals for science and technology 
 and now I build free things, where I try to use as strict a definition of "free" as 
 possible.  
 
 I don't sell stuff, and I don't work for a wage.  I build things and give them away, and 
 if people want to patronize my work, I can spend more time on it and have resources to recruit others 
 to the cause. If no one donates, I'll get by and do the work regardless because I can't help it, though.

        <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network:</a> useful reference.  Harder to understand
    than w3schools, but more complete. <img src = "mdn.png"></li>

    <li><a href = "https://codepen.io">https://codepen.io</a>Codepen is a free playground for trying code quickly.  It's not
    useful for hosting a full site, and only somewhat useful for trying stuff since it's not a full page, but it's <i>extremely</i>
        useful for learning what is possible by seeing original art in html/css/javascript by talented designer/artists.

        the W3C Consortium, or World Wide Web consortium is the non profit group which establishes and maintains the standards
        that define the web such as HTML as well as many others.  This page is somewhat frustrating to navigate and of
        limited use for learning HTML but is an important resource in predicting long term stability of software
        technologies which can be used on the Web.

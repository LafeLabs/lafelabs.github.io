<h2>Glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Geometron</b>A language which uses geometry to bridge the gap 
between humans and machines and between humans of different linguistic backgrounds.  The name follows the convention of adding a "tron"
 ending to words to describe a machine based on that word.  This is to convey that language is, in effect, a machine, and indeed the basis of all other machines.
 Geometron consists of three major parts: the Actions, the Laws, and the Hypercube structure.
</li>
<li>
<b>GVM(Geometron Virtual Machine)</b>Geometron is composed of sequences of actions, and those actions can be carried out in many ways.
The Geometron Virtual Machine is a mental construct which aids in understanding this abstractly, but putting these actions into a black box,
which we can think of as a machine regardless of how those actions are actually carried out.
</li>
<li>
<b>doTheThing</b>This is the name of the function which actually carries out the Geometron actions in JavaScript in the main Geometron code on computers.
</li>                
<li>
<b>Deck</b>A deck is a document on a certain topic, consisting of a sequence of "slides".  This format is modelled off of 
that of PowerPoint or Keynote.  The word has a double meaning and can also refer to a "deck of cards", and can in some cases
correspond to a physical deck of cards with art corresponding to elements of a document.  
</li>
<li>
<b>hyperdeck</b>A hyperdeck is a collection of decks, and represents another layer up in organization of information.  
For example, while a sequence of maps of a given area might be in a "deck", the collection of all maps stored on a given 
machine would be a "map hyperdeck".  In general, a hyperdeck has a unique web address which references data stored in a file called
"data.txt", which is in JSON format as an array of deck objects, each of which is an array of slide objects, which describe
information to be displayed on a screen. 
</li>
<li>
<b>hypercube</b>The Geometron Hypercube is a geometric method of organizing information.  Types of information, such as 
style, actions, keys on a keyboard, etc.  are stored in 8X8 arrays called tablets.  There are a stack of 8 tablets
(with some odd exceptions in terms of size of each), making a cube of 8X8X8 cells of information.  Each of these cells
is described by an address in base 8, with a leading zero to denote that it's base 8.  Each cell corresponds to both 
an action and a symbol to describe that action.  The term "hypercube" refers to the fact that there are thus two cubes, 
one for symbols and one for actions, making it a four dimensional object, traditionally referred to as a hypercube.  
The hypercube is designed to be easily represented in virtual reality to facilitate rapid exchange of components of 
the hypercube with other Geometron users.  Each cell in each cube consists of a sequence of addresses of cells in the 
hypercube(thus demonstrating the law that "everything is recursive").
</li>
<li>
<b>Address</b>The location of a cell of information in the Geometron Hypercube.  This is generally either a 3 or 4 digit number
in base 8.   
</li>
<li>
<b>glyph</b>Glyphs in Geometron are a sequence of actions.  Each action is in turn a glyph, and is symbolized by a symbol which 
is drawn with a sequence of actions which are also glyphs and which also have symbols.  Everything is recursive.
</li>
<li>
<b>Action</b>Action is one of the two fundamental types of information that exist in the Geometron world view, along with symbol.
An action is like a "verb" in a human language or a function in a computer language.
</li>
<li>
<b>Symbol</b>Symbols are the other of the two fundamental types of information that exist in the Geometron world view, along with actions.
A symbol is like a pictograph in a human language(a character in Chinese or a letter in English for example), or a 
variable name in a computer language.  
</li>
<li>
<b>Metabot</b>Metabot is a machine architecture designed to apply the Geometron language in the most general possible way to 
electro mechanical devices.  Physically it consists of a Geometron hypercube which self documents the whole system, generalized
control boards for motors, heaters, drive coils or other devices for doing mechanical work, and software.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ego death</b> The process by which the modern human rejects failed models of the self by examining and contemplating
forms observed in other organisms such as insects and fungi, as well as the fundamental study of the nature of language.  
</li>
<li>
<b>Laws</b> Sets of statements wich are easy to learn and easy to understand and remember which, when believed, lead to 
a desired outcome for the believer.
</li>
<li>
<b>Cubic Bezier curve(or path)</b>A way of defining smooth non circular curves in which the end points and a pair of anchor points 
are used to describe the whole curve.  Geometron allows arbitrary Bezier paths to be defined using the position, orientation 
and scale of the cursor at the start and end of the curve.  
</li>
<li>
<b>Cursor</b>From the Latin for "runner", the cursor is a graphical element that represents the 
users position in a sequence of actions.  On a computer, in familiar software, the cursor either represents the position of
a mouse pointer for graphical interfaces or of text insertion for keyboard driven interfaces.  Geometron generalizes this 
concept to include a larger set of properties of the editor.  In addition to position, the cursor contains information about 
symmetry, angle, scale, and size.  Also, this is not limited to computers.  When Geometron actions are carried out with 
physical, non-digital art supplies, a physical cursor may be used in the form of various shapes of different sizes, 
documented here.
</li>
<li>
<b>H Bridge</b>This is a circuit which allows a source of electrical voltage such as a battery or USB power supply to 
drive somthing in either direction, where some externally controlled switch can turn it on or off in either 
direction of current flow.  In general an H bridg has 4 transistors, all four of which are required.  It is one of the 
fundamental building blocks of the Metabot, and needed for almost all robotics technology.
</li>
<li>
<b>HTML(Hypertext Markup Language)</b>This is a way of formatting raw text so that, when read by a web browser, it is 
rendered into visually complex displays, including various fonts, languages, images, shapes, etc.  Standard Geometron
 is built on top of HTML, along with several other computer languages.  HTML is the most widely used language for communication 
 over a computer by far, and is readable by most of the several billion mobile devices currently in use.
</li>
<li>
<b>CSS(Cascaded Style Sheets)</b>CSS is bound together with HTML, and can be embedded inside an HTML document using the 
"style" tag. Its purpose is to streamline the description of style information in web documents.  Geometron places 
CSS information in the 0500's address space(0500-0577).
</li>
<li>
<b>JavaScript</b> The language for taking action in a web browser.  Like CSS, this language is built into the modern 
version of HTML(HTML5), and is accssed via the "script" tag.  Standard Geometron uses JavaScript for almost all actions, 
building graphics, moving from one place to another in a file, changing the content of documents, and connecting with 
other computers and files than the one currently in use.  
</li>
<li>
<b>JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)</b>A simple system for organizing information using curly 
brackets "{" and "}", square brackets "[" and "]", colons,
and names that go in quotes.  
</li>
<li>
<b>PHP(Php Hypertext Processor)</b>A computer language used to carry out actions on a web server.  This is 
by far the most commonly and easily used "server side" language, and is used in standard Geometron via programs called 
saver.php to save files on the web server which hosts the Geometron Hypercube currently in use. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Hypertext</b> The concept of which HTML is a specific implementation: text which contains links to other text.  
</li>
<li>
<b>Web Browser</b> Any of several free pieces of software which render HTML documents into pixels displayed on a screen.
Web browsers exist for almost all computers in existence today, including mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, laptops, 
game consoles, modern "smart" televisions and numerous newly developed devices.  There are numerous browser to choose from, 
all of which are free, many of which work on many platforms.  
</li>        
<li>
<b>QR Code</b> An array of black and white squares which can be easily scanned by a smart phone or tablet to launch a 
web browser pointed to a specific web page.
</li>
<li>
<b>Server</b> A computer which stores HTML files and distributes them over a network connection to "clients", which then
display those files in a web browser.   This, along with clients, is a fundamental building block of the current Web.
</li>
<li>
<b>Client</b>For the purposes of Geometron, any computer running a web browser.
</li>
<li>
<b>WWW(World Wide Web)</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Internet</b>

<b>Art Replicator</b>The machine frequently mistakenly called a "computer" is, in many contexts, better described by this term.
Over time the machines called "computers" have evolved more and more into something centered on a very high resolution screen, 
designed to rapidly share images to other screens.  Since the decision to create more machines is made largely based on how
information travels to the humans making those decisions, this is the replication path for the machine.  Thus rather than 
studying "computers" if we want to understand these machines we must understand art raplicators instead.
</li>
<li>
<b>Art layer</b> In modern computer science, the different functions of a computer system are often reffered to as a 
"stack", with "layers", where for some reason all technology is a vertical pile of objects.  In this world view, the "art stack" 
is a layer focused exclusively on art.

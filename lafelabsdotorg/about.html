<h2>LafeLabs</h2>
<p>
        I am Lafe Spietz, creator of the 
        <a href = "http://www.geometronics.org">Geometron</a> language.  Geometron is a system for creating languages, both
        for human-human communication and for human-machine interaction, and the main application at this time is for 
        <a href = "http://www.quantumart.org">streamlining graphical communication in the quantum information field</a>, 
        although there are numerous other applications detailed on the main geometron site[geometronics.org].

        LafeLabs represents the research creations of Lafe Spietz, the sole author of this page 
        and creator of the works linked from here.  I have worked on techonlogy development and applied physics in 
        public and private universities, in startups including two I founded, with large companies, and with the Federal 
        and foriegn governments.  I found that none of these provided an environment in which it was possible to 
        pursue the kind of technology I feel compelled to build.  Thus LafeLabs was born as a way to 
        put all my research under one roof outside of these systems.  
</p>        
<p>
    As a matter of principle, all work I do is released into the public domain without patents or any other form of IP.

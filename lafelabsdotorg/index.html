Websites are containers for information which exists in hyperspace.

A website is literally a website, although it can be local, it will generally be world readable.  A website has a purpose,
defined by actions and symbols and narrative.  Website = A Universe defined by a path of actions, a way of life. 

A website represents a mode of human existence.  A commercial website divides these modes into
worker, manager, investor, user, advertiser.  A geometron website does not.  The site defines a mode of existence, and 
to live another way is to use another site.  As there will be trillions of sites, this means there will be thousands of sites 
per human for all of humanity, thus vastly expanding the human experience beyond what has ever even been considered before.
 
Hyperspace is the space of information which can be parsed with Geometron.

Geometron hypercubes are instances of the geometron metalanguage, which are like a 
conceptual lense through which the mind can interact with information, just as
a microscope or telescope is a optical lense to literally let the human eye interact with a wider range of optics. 

Each hypercube is constantly changing.  The viewpoint of the hypercube, along with various links and metadata are in a
JSON object which represents a "page" on a "card".  Pages are sequential, and are just indexed by how they exist in the
array of a given card.

A deck is an array of cards, where each card has an address in 04xx space.  A card is a JSON array stored at currentDataArray,
and the current *page* in the current card is in currentData, a global JavaScript object.  

A deck is an array of objects.  Each of these objects is a card, represented by a name, an address, and an array of page objects.
Each deck should be a directory.  Each directory has index.html, editor.html, data.txt.   data.txt has text representing 
the array of objects as described.  editor.html edits this whole thing, and can navigate it all, and references saver.php 
to save to data.txt if there is permission to do that.  A cron job with some python can push diffs of data.txt to various 
public feeds or archives.  

website has index.html which links to decks
decks are directories with cards in data.txt, edited with editor.html, viewed with index.html

each deck directory has a subdirectory "/svg" which has the saved svg's in it.  
SVGfeed.html lets one view these in an html file.

<h1>Statement of Principles</h1>

<ul>
<li>
The purpose of technology is to create an environment in which all human needs are provided for for free to all humans.  
</li><li>
A "technological complete set" is a collection of technologies which, together, provide this.
</li><li>
Any technology which is not part of a technological complete set is incomplete, and the highest priority for any technologist working on that technology is to complete it.  
</li><li>
Technology should be built to minimize the number of humans and the amount of human labor required to complete a set, creating maximum personal freedom for each human to leave one set and join another.
</li><li>
A technological set cannot be considered to be complete unless it may be built from an existing stream of material, called the Trash Feed, which can be a combination of elements from the existing industrial system(waste) and from the natural world such as sunlight and rain.
</li><li>
The purpose of science is to create the strongest possible link between the physical world and the human mind.
</li><li>
Until such time as the technology a science is based on is complete, all science should be focused on completing the set, building the tools needed to finish that project prior to moving on to obscure studies.
</li><li>
In order for a science and technology st to be complete it must include the full process for teaching others, from scratch, the process of reconstructing that set on their own.  A set which cannot reproduce itself using some form of education build into the set is not complete. 
</li><li>
All professionalism is counter-productive to the goals of achieving a technological complete set.   Creating and guarding professions such as "physicist", "artist", or "manager" is in direct opposition to making technology that can work for free. We must therefore oppose professionalism in all forms until such time as our technology forms a complete set, smashing down boundaries as needed to get things done.  Artists must build circuits, engineers must write poems, and managers need to stop wasting everyone's time. 
</li><li>
In particular the fields known as software "engineering" and computer "science" are neither engineering nor science, and are simply a criminal cartel of priests who help those in power gain and maintain more power and control over the rest of humanity.  Silicon valley cannot and should not be reformed, it must be destroyed completely and its culture completely wiped out, and unwelcome in the world of civilized humans.  It is telling that the priests of this religion choose to call themselves "tech". This is a propaganda piece to dress up their power system, re-branding illegal and unethical cab services, illegal and unethical hotel services and advertising agencies as "technology", when in fact they have held back technological progress for the last 40 years.  I will always use scare quotes around the word "tech" when referring to the technocratic priests to differentiate their cartel from real technology.  
</li><li>
Furthermore the cartel known as "journalists" have no positive value toward building a better society.  Even those who claim to be independent or "alternative" are part of creating a unified narrative for humanity which is counter productive to the goal of a free and complete technical set.  Therefore it is my policy to never talk to journalists, even socially, and even if they claim to be "bloggers" or some other type of nonsense.  
</li><li>
The use of violence and threats of violence to enforce political will on people is, by definition, terrorism.  All states and corporations are based on terrorism.  Wage labor, landlordism, and nationalism are *always* of a terrorist nature.  We include the witholding of basic needs from existing technology as a form of violence.  Indeed this is the primary nature of violence in todays world, vastly exceeding direct violence in scale in most of the world. 
</li><li>
The opposite of terrorism is creating technology that satisfies human needs and giving it away freely, with no bias in regards to the recipients' ideology, politics, behavior, religion, or any other specific characteristics. It should be the goal of all people to carry out the opposite of terrorism.  This is not a political process, it is physical: it involves building actual things in the physical world and no amount of meetings, writings, elections or speeches can ever accomplish the needed tasks.  We therefore reject the political process as illegitimate in all cases and forms.  
</li><li>
The ideological poison that has made our world so violent in an age of what should be infinite plenty is a worship of numbers.  The belief that numbers can be used to quantify human value is based on the origins of our society in an extraction-based economy, and one based on human exploitation, and it involves a religious belief in the reality of numbers that is not upheld by obvious observations of Nature.   
</li><li>
A path out of this ideological/religious trap is to create a value system based more on geometry than numbers.  This geometry must reject the mysticism of Plato and Euclid, and judge the quality of ideas on how well they help us build useful things and tell interesting stories.
</li>

This is the Geometron core, both the main operational unit and the documentation, which should never again be separated.  It should be self-contained, self-replicating, and self-documented.  All other instances of Geometron should connect back to here, and main changes to the core should start and end here as long as I am the author, and this should be instanced for other future authors as well.

Genesis Glyph is Address 0000, which is this document in plain standard English written in pure 7 bit ASCII, html5, css and javascript
<p>
Genesis glyph must contain all the mapping functions here in the head element.
It must have code that converts the rest of the Root Magic Table to a function rootMagic() as well as the commands in the 0300s to the function doTheThing()
<p>
glyph number 0001 is then a replacement for initgeometron, which will get invoked here after the code is constructed

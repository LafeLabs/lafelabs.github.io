### Another idea: shot noise thermometer dot com

 - 3d model of resistor bridge
 - dolan bridge calculator
 - links to all labs currently doing work
 - detailed fab recipes
 - fab data from various labs, history of fabs
 - WKB tunnel barrier calculator
 - calculator of theory noise plot
 - data fitter of noise plot
 - data fitter of noise vs frequency spectrum to get noise and gain
 - parametric amplifier calculator
 - SVGs of various shot noise chips
 - SVGs of various amp chips
 - links to all references
 - series of calculators with various stages added including the whole typical measurement chain
 - classroom demonstration detailed instructions
 - quantum noise units rant
 - RC line filter calculator with tapeworm and some other similar filters
 - links to all the relevant suppliers
 - svgs with editable code in geometron which can be extracted to be used in documents for all typical figures: circuits, diagrams, etc
 - SQUID calculators
 - story of the invention of the shot noise thermometer
 - local copies of all papers published by everyone on the set
 - link to all the papers referencing the initial paper
 - RF noise leak checking details, videos etc
 - forum for comments and posts and data to test the concept of geometron social media
 - ad explaining how this concept is just a test and can be deployed in other fields that actually have money in them: quantum information, brand language creation, education, religion, symbology
 - geometron tutorial 
 - knowledge map

 
 
 Maybe I should buy and set up quantumnoise.org to make it clear that it's not commercial as a site.

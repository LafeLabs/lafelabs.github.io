<h3>Geometron</h3>

I call this a geometric "meta-language", meaning it is intended as a language in which languages are written, which uses geometric operations to create structure in space without reference to either a specific human language or specific machine language.  Click here for examples, applications, details, sample code and apps and publications.

<h3>Action Geometry--Classical geometry modernized for practical use</h3>

This is a set of geometric constructions I have put together to help people learn geometry in a way that immediately helps with everyday life.  These constructions are designed to build a foundation on which a whole set of technology can be created, eventually making up all the parts needed for a "technological complete set", which is the full array of technologies needed for humans to live for free.

<h3>Applied Modern Alchemy</h3>

In line with my assertion that the main future of science and technology is working on organizing it more effectively for practial use, I have gone back to the old conecepts of what used to be called "alchemy" and used that structure to build a set of elements that can be used to reorganize modern applied physics in a more intuitive way.  I have used the five "elements" of Earth, Air, Water, Fire, and Ion for this, and have constructed "elementals" and a set of technologies based on those which can be used to create a wide variety of practical devices and research paths.  

<h3>Political Philosophy(Trash Magic)</h3>

My political philosophical manifesto(and action coloring book) is my book on the subject of political philosophy which describes how I believe humanity has gone wrong with how we relate to technology, science, and each other, and what can be done about that.  It is available as a free pdf/ebook, and at cost(for about 5 bucks) as a 6X9 paperback book from LuLu press.

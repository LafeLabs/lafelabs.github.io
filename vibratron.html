<h1>Vibratron: generalized electric motor</h1>


<h2>The Problem</h2>

Motors are needed for just about everything we do.  We transmit energy in electrical form, then need to turn it back into mechanical form in most cases to do useful things with it. A wide variety of life saving technologies involve pumps of fluids and gasses, and all of these require motors.  Industrial production with any automation requires often large numbers of motors, and relatively complex control of them.  Moving goods around from one place to another generally involves electric motors, even if some other engine is also used.  We need them for cooling, heating, moving air around, moving water around, moving ourselves around, and moving goods around. 

<p>

Motors suffer from several of the pathologies of most modern industrial artifacts including:

<ul>
<li>They are generally made from mined materials or materials that are from a bulk recycle process, and have parts that cannot be easily re-arranged between one motor and another</li>
<li>They are often frustrating to connect to arbitrary systems, and are shipped with smooth shafts that, without being modified or welded to something, don't do anything useful</li>
<li>Changes in torque are usually accomplished with gears, which are precision machined in such a way as to inevitably degrade and fail and be next to impossible to repair</li>
<li>The motor itself usually has brushes with friction which fail and are designed to be never replaced, making the entire artifact into waste because of one designed-to-fail part</li>
<li>Motors are generally designed to be installed in one machine, and not be used for anything other than that function.  Again, the deliberately unusable smooth shaft is part of this, and it means the "consumer" is forced to buy dozens of motors that all do exactly the same thing and when any one fails the other motors cannot be used to replace the failed one.</li>
<li>Brushless motors are absurdly expensive and complicated, and have opaque control hardware and firmware, clearly designed to keep them as hard to use and modify as possible.</li>
<li>Motor manufacturers in general do not incorporate any of the needed electronic hardware required to make the motor actually useful which might include flyback diodes, H bridge circuits, speed controls, or anything of that kind.  Again this deliberately makes them hard to use for anyone not part of the existing industrial capitalist system.</li>
<li>In robotics applications, motor control is generally all pushed into the world of software with relatively "dumb" controls going from some sort of microprocessor to the motors. This both cedes control to the Software Gangster Cartel who I regard as enemies of humanity and misses out on a huge array of simple feedback technologies which could exist if the control hardware actually had some thought put into it.</li>
<li>A motor is just a motor.  There is no flexibility in what they do. Sometimes you want vibration at high frequency(100's of Hz), sometimes very low(less than 1 Hz), and yet when you buy a motor,  you're forced to choose one, and then, again, are stuck with that and cannot switch based on need.</li>
</ul>

To address these things, what I seek to do here is(again with a bullet point list):

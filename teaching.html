<h1>Teaching</h1>

I teach everything I build here to as many people as possible, with the intent that those who I teach may also pass it all along, making the knowledge spread.  Some classes will always be free in all cases forever, and some I'll charge money for for some clients.  If $5000 sounds like a lot of money to you, you're probably in the category who I'll teach for free, assuming we can either do a class over video chat or that you're reachable via public transit from Washington DC(including Amtrak, so up through New England and down into the Southeast).

<ul>
 
  <li>Build your own "brand language" from Geometron</li>

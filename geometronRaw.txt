What is a Meta-Language?
A Language to build languages
Geometric:
A system where numbers follow geometry,
Geometry is always more fundamental

Glyph construction
All glyphs have an address
All addresses are octal, have both an action and a symbol
All information can be physically encoded at any level
Everything is fractal
